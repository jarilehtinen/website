This might be the 20th time I redesign my website. This time around I had two purposes: 

- To learn [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev)
- Test if the idea of huge headings could work

Eleventy is a great tool for creating static websites. It took some time figuring out how to get it work with [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com) but with few examples I managed to get it running (thanks [ramigs](https://github.com/ramigs/ramigs.dev)). There are also some great [starter projects](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/starter/) on Eleventy's site.

If you are interested seeing what is going on under the hood, my website is on [GitHub](http://github.com/jarilehtinen/website).

By the time you read this I might have already changed everything. But hey, that's whats great about web design.
